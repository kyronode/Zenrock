# Pull requests

### Welcome to pull requests!

Pull requests help you collaborate on code with other people. As pull requests are created, theyâ€™ll appear here in a searchable and filterable list. To get started, you should [create a pull request](<../../.gitbook/assets/compare (1)>).

**ProTip!** Follow long discussions with [comments:>50](broken-reference).
